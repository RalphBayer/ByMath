# ByMath
ByMath is a python library created using the power of maths for maths. 

This library contains 4 seperate packages, these are - 

1. tensor maths package
2. random number generator
3. machine learning package
4. graphing package

---

## Getting started
### Prerequisites
  1. python v3+
  
Nothing else is needed for this library.
  
### Installation
Currently the only way to install this package is through git and then adding bymath to your path for easy use.

This will be changed in the future.
  
### Examples
Try running test.py to see a tensor and scalar get added together. 

Other than that this project is still in it's early stages, howver try creating your own tensors by writting
``` Python
  import bymath as bm
  tensor = bm.Tensor(""" Your tensor as a nested list here """)
```
After, try running a few commands. Most commands will be the same as numpy for ease of use for numpy users.
